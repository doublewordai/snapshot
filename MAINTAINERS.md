# Maintainers

Maintainers review and merge pull requests, triage issues, set priorities, and
cut releases. See [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) for how decisions are made and
how maintainers are added or retired.

## Current maintainers

Maintainers are recorded as GitHub teams, referenced from
[`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS). The teams are the source of truth
for membership, so this file links to them instead of duplicating the names.

- [@ai-dynamo/snapshot-codeowners](https://github.com/orgs/ai-dynamo/teams/snapshot-codeowners)
  — code and configuration
- [@ai-dynamo/snapshot-docs-codeowners](https://github.com/orgs/ai-dynamo/teams/snapshot-docs-codeowners)
  — `docs/` and every Markdown file

Every pull request requires review from at least one member of the team that
owns the paths it touches.

Ownership beyond documentation is repository-wide rather than split per
component. As the project grows, `.github/CODEOWNERS` should be narrowed to name
owners for `agent/`, `operator/`, `api/`, and `charts/` individually.

## Contacting maintainers

- **Bugs and feature requests** — [open an issue](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/snapshot/issues)
  using one of the [issue templates](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE).
- **Questions and design discussions** — use
  [Discussions](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/snapshot/discussions).
- **Security vulnerabilities** — never in a public issue. Follow
  [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- **Code of conduct reports** — email <dbar@nvidia.com>, as described in
  [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Becoming a maintainer

Maintainers are added by consensus of the existing maintainers, normally after a
sustained record of reviewed contributions and issue triage. The process is
described in [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md).
