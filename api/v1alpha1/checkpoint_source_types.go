// CheckpointSource publishes what a checkpoint was captured on, so someone
// preparing a restore target can see it without reading the artifact. It is
// projected from the checkpoint manifest and never read back: the restore
// compatibility gates compare the manifest, not this status.
//
// Every field is optional. A value the agent could not read is absent rather
// than empty, and an artifact captured before a value was recorded publishes
// without it.

// yet is preserved rather than pruned, so a newer agent's values survive an older
// installed CRD.
