Tracking issue: [#295](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/snapshot/issues/295).
This proposal describes the implementation in the open cuinterpose PR stack;
it does not claim that the feature is merged or GPU-qualified.

## Summary

Add opt-in checkpoint and restore of CUDA memory shared between processes on
one node. Supported POSIX-exported CUDA virtual memory allocations (VMM),
synchronous memory IPC, and multicast objects retain their contents, application
virtual addresses, and sharing relationships after restore on a compatible node.

## Motivation

Saving each CUDA process independently does not reconstruct shared memory. A
saved CUDA descriptor cannot identify a newly created allocation on another
node, and separately restored copies would no longer represent shared backing.
Multicast additionally depends on member allocations, device attachments, and
bindings. Native checkpoint can refuse a workload with these resources.

Snapshot needs to preserve these relationships while leaving private CUDA state
on the native checkpoint path. This enables cooperating multi-process GPU
workloads to resume with their existing pointers and sharing semantics.

### Goals

- Preserve allocation identity, virtual addresses, contents, access permissions,
  and supported unicast and multicast sharing across checkpoint and restore.
- Save exactly one content copy per shared creator allocation in host memory
  captured by CRIU; leave never-shared allocations to native CUDA checkpoint.
- Validate the complete participant topology before destructive preparation;
  reconstruct creators before importers and verify topology before resuming.
- Deliver the shim before SnapshotJob workloads start, preserving their
  arguments and resolved environment. Preserve native CUDA jobfiles when present.
- Define application quiescence, failure, and artifact compatibility contracts
  that match the implementation.

### Non-Goals

- Cross-node live sharing, cross-Pod coordination, or changing Snapshot's native
  CUDA checkpoint implementation.
- PageBroker or CustomStorage inside the shim, storage selection, and saving all
  private allocations through the shim. Native storage integration is separate.
- Event IPC, memory-pool IPC, managed/async/pitched allocation families, foreign
  native memory-IPC handles, historical 32-bit allocation entry points, or
  general cross-context peer-access emulation.
- Automatically draining application work, supporting a changing participant
  group, or retrying, rolling back, or resuming a failed lifecycle operation.

## Proposal

An opted-in workload loads a shim in every participating CUDA process. The shim
records supported allocation ownership and sharing as the application runs. A
short-lived coordinator validates the entire group and orders preparation and
reconstruction around Snapshot's existing native CUDA and CRIU operations.

The application must finish all CUDA calls and GPU work, then remain parked
through capture and restore. All sharing peers must be interposed and included
in a fixed checkpoint group, with creators still available. The shim does not
pause application threads or make an uncooperative application checkpointable.

Before native CUDA lock, the shims save shared creator bytes into host carriers
and remove shared CUDA resources. CRIU captures those carriers as process memory.
After native CUDA restore and unlock, the shims recreate shared backing, restore
contents, and rebuild importers and multicast dependencies. Snapshot releases the
application only after the coordinator verifies the restored topology.

Unsupported exportable creates and foreign imports fail at the intercepted API,
before acquiring CUDA backing. Missing participants, missing creators, and
incomplete multicast groups fail validation before destructive preparation.
Failures or ambiguous replies during the lifecycle invalidate the attempt; the
workload must not resume with partially removed or reconstructed sharing.

### Limitations, Risks, and Mitigations

Exactly POSIX-FD exportable VMM and multicast objects are supported. FABRIC,
mixed exportable handle types, and non-POSIX multicast (including handle type
zero) are rejected before CUDA allocation or import. Tracked unicast allocations
support pinned DEVICE and HOST_NUMA backing. Private unicast VMM remains
native-owned. Shared HOST_NUMA bytes use the creator's host carrier, and restore
preserves the original NUMA placement. Memory IPC requires fully
interposed peers and the adapter's single
owning-context behavior. CUDA allocation granularity can make backing larger
than the requested malloc size.

Each multicast participant must add and bind its device in the same process.
Device ordinals are local to that participant, so different ranks may each use
device zero. Adding a device in one process and binding it from another is
outside this scope.

| Constraint or risk | Contract or mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Concurrent application activity | Applications finish all CUDA calls and GPU work before entry and stay parked. Checkpoint entry closes tracked memory mutation and rejects outstanding unlocked driver calls; it does not drain work. |
| Partial capture or restore | Run each lifecycle operation once with global barriers. Terminate an unsafe workload; do not retry a lost reply or roll back partial driver mutation. |
| Exported allocation lifetime | The original creator retains a generic handle or local mapping while exported descriptors or imported allocations remain usable. A virtual shareable FD alone does not retain creator backing. |
| Host-memory pressure | Budget approximately one host copy of shared creator backing plus metadata and temporary mappings. Carriers use pinned memory during transfers and enlarge CRIU images. Importers do not save duplicate bytes. |
| Platform and CUDA compatibility | Require Linux/amd64, glibc 2.34 or newer for the preload libraries, CUDA Runtime 12.0 or newer when using a runtime library, compatible GPUs/drivers, and the VMM/multicast APIs the workload uses. Existing Snapshot/CRIU privilege and compatibility requirements still apply. |
| Fork and loader behavior | Lookup starts no runtime. Fork before CUDA initialization allows child initialization; children forked after initialization must exec or exit. Fork during initialization and long-lived fork children during checkpoint are unsupported. |
| Checkpoint/artifact mismatch | Require identical frontend and core SHA-256 hashes at restore and a compatible coordinator protocol. Keep library files stable during capture; recreate obsolete draft checkpoints. |
| Incomplete qualification | Physical-GPU and cross-node qualification are required in addition to repository checks; earlier revision results do not qualify the revised implementation. |

## Design Details

### API

There are no new CRDs or CRD fields. The workload Pod template opts in with:

```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    nvidia.com/cuinterpose-enabled: "true"
```

The annotation keeps its trimmed `strconv.ParseBool` spellings: `1`, `t`, `T`,
`true`, `TRUE`, and `True` enable it; `0`, `f`, `F`, `false`, `FALSE`, and `False`
disable it. Absence disables the request; an invalid present value is a source
validation error.

Automatic delivery applies to SnapshotJob sources and their single target
container. Immediately before creating the source Job, the operator copies
`libcuinterpose.so`, `libcuinterpose_core.so`, and `cuinterpose-launch` from the
agent image into an `emptyDir` mounted read-only at `/tmp/snapshot-cuda`. It
requires an explicit target-container `command` and prefixes that command with
the launcher; `args` and `env` remain unchanged. Missing commands and reserved
name or mount collisions fail controller validation before Job creation. Images
using their default entrypoint must supply it explicitly; the operator does not
resolve registry metadata. Existing-Job adoption retains its original identity
checks and is independent of current delivery settings.

The static launcher prepends `/tmp/snapshot-cuda/libcuinterpose.so` to the
runtime-resolved `LD_PRELOAD` and directly executes the original command. It
preserves existing preload bytes, non-UTF-8 environment values, and argument
boundaries, with no shell or persistent parent. Image environment, `envFrom`,
and explicit Pod environment retain their normal precedence.

Ordinary Pods require delivery before process startup: place both libraries at
`/tmp/snapshot-cuda` and preload `/tmp/snapshot-cuda/libcuinterpose.so`. Adding an
annotation to a running Pod cannot activate the shim. The fixed library paths
are also supplied by the restore agent.

The coordinator's internal CLI takes `--inspect`, `--prepare`, or `--restore`,
`--control-dir`, and a repeated `--process` namespace PID. Preparation and
restore also require `--checkpoint-dir`; inspection accepts no checkpoint path.
The agent supplies this participant list; the coordinator does not discover
participants through a rendezvous protocol.

Native CUDA jobfiles remain supported: existing files are staged, refreshed after
checkpoint, and restored through the native helper. Verified shim activation
permits an absent jobfile; it does not bypass validation of an existing file.
Native multi-GPU workloads keep the jobfile requirement. The launcher does not
enable native CUDA jobfile creation; the optional
`snapshotctl --cuda-checkpoint-wrap` path remains available.
[#362](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/snapshot/issues/362)
tracks native multi-GPU launch setup separately.

#### CuInterpose shim

The shim is loaded inside each CUDA process, not run as a sidecar. Its C frontend, `libcuinterpose.so`, receives intercepted calls. Its Rust backend, `libcuinterpose_core.so`, owns allocation state, mappings, cached export descriptors, and host carriers. CUDA calls execute inside the process that owns the CUDA contexts.

Each shim listens on `/snapshot-control/cuinterpose-<namespace-pid>.sock`. The same Unix socket accepts coordinator commands and peer requests for export descriptors. Peer connections are opened when needed; there is no permanent all-to-all connection set.

The backend separates CUDA API policy from resource ownership:

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `handlers.rs` | Argument validation, native versus tracked decisions, and API-level orchestration. |
| `driver.rs` | Real CUDA calls and temporary context switching. |
| `runtime/` | Runtime installation, process ownership, sticky failure, and control workers. |
| `memory/mod.rs` | The resource registry, virtual handle ownership, and tracked address ranges. |
| `memory/vmm.rs` | Unicast backing adoption, retain/map bookkeeping, and access permissions. |
| `memory/sharing.rs` | Shareable-handle encoding, exact-PID peer requests, cached exports, and imports. |
| `memory/ipc.rs` | Malloc reservations, IPC-handle encoding, repeated opens, and synchronized release. |
| `memory/multicast.rs` | Multicast lifetime, unlocked collective calls, bindings, and reconstruction. |
| `memory/checkpoint.rs` | Inspection, local phase validation, checkpoint mutation, and completion. |
| `memory/host_carrier.rs` | Saving and loading shared allocation bytes. |

Handlers do not call other CUDA handlers. They share memory operations that own
their bookkeeping. Operations that release the registry lock for a
blocking CUDA call use one process-wide `unlocked_driver_calls` counter. Peer FD service
uses only the export cache lock, never the registry lock.

The control worker routes requests and sends replies; checkpoint code owns phase
transitions and fail-stop decisions. After sending a successful LOAD reply, the
worker reports completion to checkpoint code so it can release the host carrier.

#### CuInterpose coordinator

The Rust `cuinterpose-coordinator` is a short-lived executable statically linked
with musl. Separate instances inspect, prepare capture, and reconstruct after
native restore. Inspection reads every participant using the existing `INSPECT`
message and validates topology without changing phase or writing state. The
coordinator does not call CUDA or copy allocation bytes.

Checkpoint entry and inspection visit participants sequentially. Each mutating lifecycle operation is dispatched concurrently to all participants, and the coordinator waits for every reply before advancing. This matters for multicast calls that need other ranks to make progress.

There are no identity or rendezvous messages. Preparation sends four coordinator
requests to each process: `BEGIN_CHECKPOINT`, `PREPARE_MULTICAST`, `SAVE_ALLOCATIONS`,
and `PREPARE_UNICAST`. Restore sends eight: an initial `INSPECT`,
`LOAD_ALLOCATIONS`, `RESTORE_UNICAST`, the four ordered multicast operations,
and a final `INSPECT`. Restoring an imported allocation or multicast object also
causes one peer export request to its creator; that data-dependent traffic is
the actual FD handoff, not discovery.

#### Snapshot agent

The agent uses its existing CUDA process census to inspect mapped libraries in
every participant and invokes read-only coordinator inspection before preparation.
It sequences native CUDA checkpoint/restore and CRIU, and releases the
application's restore-complete wait only after both native CUDA and CuInterpose
reconstruction succeed.

#### Host-carrier module

The Rust `host_carrier` module copies shared creator allocations into one host arena per process and copies them back during restore. DEVICE allocations are grouped by CUDA context and device, mapped into a temporary consecutive address range, and copied asynchronously on one stream per group. HOST_NUMA allocations use CPU copies through temporary host-accessible VMM aliases of their full backing. These aliases preserve application mappings and permissions.

The arena is registered as pinned host memory for each save or load transfer. The registration's context remains alive until all copies finish and the arena is unregistered. Between transfers the carrier is ordinary anonymous memory. If no recorded context remains, DEVICE backing uses its device ordinal for the primary-context fallback and HOST_NUMA backing uses CUDA device zero. This fallback never changes the allocation's NUMA node ID; restore recreates its original allocation properties.

### How calls are intercepted

The frontend handles direct CUDA symbol calls, `dlsym`, `cuGetProcAddress*`, and the CUDA runtime's `cudaGetDriverEntryPoint*` queries. A resolver query calls the real resolver first. Only a successful lookup of a supported API is replaced, using the actual returned symbol to choose the correct calling convention. A result the frontend cannot wrap is reported as a missing symbol: a `NULL` pointer with that API's "symbol not found" status, or `CUDA_ERROR_NOT_FOUND` from `cuGetProcAddress` without a status argument.

The frontend obtains glibc's real `dlsym` with `dlvsym(RTLD_NEXT, "dlsym", "GLIBC_2.34")` and caches it without a once-guard. `dlvsym` takes glibc's loader lock, which `dlopen` holds while running constructors, so waiting for another thread's lookup could deadlock.

glibc chooses the `RTLD_DEFAULT` and `RTLD_NEXT` search scope from its caller's return address. The frontend's `dlsym` therefore passes these lookups to glibc as a tail call (`musttail`, GCC 15 or newer) and returns the result unchanged. Only lookups with an explicit handle are made by the frontend and may return wrappers. On first relevant CUDA activity it loads `$ORIGIN/libcuinterpose_core.so` with `RTLD_LAZY | RTLD_LOCAL`. glibc expands the frontend's load-time directory, so a later `chdir` does not change backend discovery. This is glibc-based lookup, not a custom ELF loader. The frontend's linker export list exposes only its intended CUDA/resolver functions; `-Bsymbolic-functions` keeps its own internal function references local.

The private C ABI contains `FrontendAbi` and `BackendAbi` tables. Cbindgen generates the table declarations, while NVIDIA's `cuda.h` supplies C CUDA types and cudarc supplies the corresponding Rust definitions. Runtime preparation resolves the backend's driver function table through the frontend before acquiring the installation or process-state mutex. It publishes the completed table without running loader calls inside a `OnceLock` initializer. Backend driver calls then use cached pointers, including context and cleanup calls; missing optional symbols fail only when used. CUDA providers remain loaded for the process lifetime. Cudarc's loader and buffer/context wrappers are not used. Rust objects and ownership do not cross the ABI.

Loading the backend and starting its runtime are separate operations:

| Operation | Concurrency and lifetime |
| --- | --- |
| ABI registration (`cuinterpose_core_init`) | Copies the frontend table and returns an immutable backend table. Repeated or concurrent registrations must agree on the resolver. It starts no workers and makes no frontend callbacks. |
| Frontend publication | Concurrent callers may each `dlopen` the backend; glibc serializes its construction. Atomic publication retains one process-lifetime library reference and closes redundant references. Same-thread constructor reentry returns `CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED` without poisoning a later call. |
| Runtime startup | Only successful intercepted `cuInit` calls `ensure_cuinterpose_initialized`, which prepares private candidates and installs one process runtime, control socket, and worker pair. Concurrent callers reuse the installed runtime; same-thread preparation reentry returns `CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED` without poisoning it. |

There is no frontend-wide loading lock. The backend's installation lock remains
necessary for unique runtime resources. A `OnceLock` publishes the completed
runtime; its initializer never performs loader-sensitive startup.
Obtaining the ABI table alone does not mean runtime services are ready.

#### Backend runtime installation

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Prepare private tracking state and channels"] --> B["Spawn workers parked on empty channels"]
    B --> C["Acquire installation mutex"]
    C --> D{"Failed runtime / healthy winner / no winner?"}
    D -->|failed| E["Return sticky failure"]
    D -->|healthy winner| F["Reuse installed runtime"]
    D -->|no winner| G["Bind, configure, activate listener; publish state"]
    E --> H["Unlock, then discard private candidate"]
    F --> H
    G --> H
```

Thread creation can register Rust TLS destructors with glibc's loader. A CUDA
caller in a DSO constructor already holds that loader lock. Preparation therefore
owns no installation mutex: that caller can prepare its own candidate instead
of waiting for another thread blocked in loader-sensitive startup. Installation
never waits for a worker-running acknowledgment. Readiness means successful
thread creation, not proof that a worker has already been scheduled.

Only the installer binds the canonical endpoint. One nonblocking listener
handoff activates the peer worker, which owns the control queue's only sender.
Discarding a candidate disconnects that chain so both workers eventually exit;
callers never join them. Cleanup, unlinking, logging, and candidate destruction
happen outside the installation mutex. There can temporarily be two private
workers per contender, but only one installed pair.

Installed failure is checked before installed state. A failed private candidate
may reuse an already-installed healthy winner; it never waits for an unfinished
candidate. Without a winner, a real preparation or installation error remains
sticky. Memory calls require a ready runtime owned by the calling PID; they never start
it themselves. Function lookup remains independent of runtime readiness.

The bounded commit path is audited for the pinned Rust/Linux/glibc implementation:

- Backend ELF eager binding prevents first-use PLT lookup while holding the mutex.
- The preparation guard initializes non-destructible backend TLS before commit.
  Rust futex mutexes and panic-count TLS do not register loader destructors.
- The capacity-one activation channel is preallocated. `try_send` never enters
  blocking-send context initialization; wakeups use non-Drop TLS and futex
  unparking. Receiver context setup happens before its waker lock is held.
- Bind/listen, nonblocking setup, and chmod make no frontend callbacks or
  formatted/logging calls. Arbitrary allocator/libc interposers that call the
  loader are outside this assumption.

Lookup alone starts no workers and creates no endpoint. Fork before CUDA
initialization permits independent initialization in each child. Once CUDA is
initialized, fork children must exec or exit; they cannot restart the shim.
Fork during initialization and long-lived fork children during checkpoint are
outside this contract.

The Rust workspace uses `panic = "abort"` in debug and release builds. A panic
in any shim thread, including background workers, terminates the process
without stack unwinding or destructor cleanup. No catch-and-abort wrapper is
needed at the C ABI. Cargo unit tests still use unwinding; their panic behavior
does not qualify the shipped libraries. The shim cannot continue after a panic
that may have interrupted a state-changing operation. This does not make invalid
application pointers, foreign C++ exceptions, or allocator aborts recoverable.

| Intercepted APIs | What the shim does |
| --- | --- |
| `cuInit` | Initializes the shim alongside CUDA. |
| `cuMemCreate`, `cuMemRelease`, `cuMemRetainAllocationHandle` | Tracks supported VMM allocations and translates application-visible virtual allocation handles to the CUDA driver handle. |
| `cuMemMap`, `cuMemUnmap`, `cuMemSetAccess` | Records address ranges, allocation offsets, and access permissions. |
| `cuMemGetAllocationPropertiesFromHandle` | Resolves virtual handles and preserves application-visible allocation properties. |
| `cuMemExportToShareableHandle`, `cuMemImportFromShareableHandle` | Replaces raw export FDs with virtual shareable handles and imports the creator's real allocation through a peer request. |
| `cuMemAlloc_v2`, `cuMemFree_v2`, `cuMemGetAddressRange_v2` | Implements synchronous device malloc with VMM backing, frees it, and reports the application's requested range. |
| `cuCtxDestroy*`, `cuDevicePrimaryCtxReset*`, `cuDevicePrimaryCtxRelease*` | Reclaims converted malloc/IPC mappings after successful context teardown; nonfinal primary releases preserve them. |
| `cuIpcGetMemHandle`, `cuIpcOpenMemHandle`, `cuIpcOpenMemHandle_v2`, `cuIpcCloseMemHandle` | Implements supported memory IPC using the same VMM records and peer export service, without native memory-IPC calls. |
| `cuMulticastCreate`, `cuMulticastAddDevice`, `cuMulticastBindMem*`, `cuMulticastBindAddr*`, `cuMulticastUnbind` | Tracks multicast objects, device membership, bindings, and their reconstruction. |

Property-only queries such as `cuMemGetAllocationGranularity` and `cuMulticastGetGranularity` go directly to CUDA.

Modern proc-address aliases for malloc/free/address-range queries are handled without treating historical 32-bit ELF entry points as modern APIs.

CUDA Runtime 11 is unsupported. Before calling a runtime driver-entry lookup,
the frontend resolves `cudaRuntimeGetVersion` in the same library as the lookup
function and requires version 12.0 or newer. Older versions, a missing version
function, or a failed version query return `cudaErrorInitializationError` without
calling the lookup or accessing the caller's output and status pointers. This
also avoids reading the absent fourth argument of CUDA 11's three-argument API.
The same version guard applies to the `ByVersion` and per-thread variants.

One CUDA runtime library per process is supported. It must be visible globally
or already retained through an intercepted handle lookup before a runtime
wrapper resolves it. Multiple CUDA runtimes and an undiscovered runtime confined
to `RTLD_LOCAL` are unsupported; the shim does not route calls by runtime caller.

Explicit `dlvsym` calls and CUDA libraries loaded in separate linker namespaces bypass this interception. Arbitrary chains of other `dlsym` interposers are not supported. A library opened with `RTLD_DEEPBIND` that links a CUDA library directly resolves its direct calls and its `RTLD_DEFAULT` lookups to that library, not to the preloaded wrappers.

### Workload operation before capture

#### Process identity and allocation ownership

The namespace PID is the shim process identity and directly determines its
socket name: `/snapshot-control/cuinterpose-<namespace-pid>.sock`. A separate
random 128-bit allocation ID identifies each tracked allocation or multicast
object. Together, the creator namespace PID and allocation ID identify an
allocation across processes.

The agent supplies one `--process <namespace-pid>` argument for every expected
CUDA process. Because the coordinator runs inside the target PID and mount
namespaces, it can connect to each exact socket without scanning the control
directory or asking shims to identify themselves. Its first capture request is
`BEGIN_CHECKPOINT`; restore also requires the supplied namespace PID set to match the
keys saved in `cuinterpose.state`.

CRIU preserves namespace PIDs, allocation IDs, state records, virtual allocation
handles, and virtual handle bytes in process memory. Restore recreates the
captured namespace PID, so the runtime ownership check continues to match.
A child forked before CUDA initialization gets its own runtime on successful
`cuInit`.

After same-PID exec or PID reuse, the previous listener can be gone while its
socket pathname remains. Runtime installation reclaims only an owned socket
whose nonblocking connection probe immediately reports `ECONNREFUSED`. It
rechecks the pathname identity before removing it and retrying bind once, under
the runtime installation lock. Live listeners, full queues, non-socket paths,
symlinks, and ambiguous probe failures are preserved.

For example, suppose A creates a 2 MiB allocation and B imports it:

| | Worker A | Worker B |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Namespace PID | `41` | `42` |
| Allocation ID | `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa` | The same ID |
| Role for this allocation | Creator | Importer |
| Application mapping | `0x700000000000` | `0x710000000000` |

The addresses can differ: each process has its own address space. The shared allocation ID says that both mappings refer to the same backing. After restore, those addresses and IDs stay the same, but the driver handles and export FDs are newly created.

An allocation is *exportable* when its creation properties allow a shareable handle. That does not mean it needs a host carrier. It becomes *shared* after a successful tracked export/import or a binding into tracked multicast. Once marked shared, closing a virtual shareable handle or removing a binding does not change it back to private.

| Allocation state | Who saves and restores its bytes? |
| --- | --- |
| Ordinary nonexportable `cuMemCreate`, including HOST_NUMA | Native CUDA. |
| Tracked POSIX-capable allocation never shared | Native CUDA; cuinterpose leaves its driver handles and application mappings intact. |
| Shim-managed malloc never shared | Native CUDA, even though its backing can be exported. |
| Shared pinned DEVICE or HOST_NUMA creator allocation | The creator shim's host carrier. |
| Imported shared allocation | No second content copy; the importer reconnects to the creator's restored allocation. |
| Tracked allocation used by multicast | The creator's host carrier, even if there was no unicast virtual shareable handle export. |

Only supported exportable creator allocations that are pinned, marked shared, and located at DEVICE or HOST_NUMA enter the host carrier. A shared allocation whose application handles were released but whose mapping remains can recover a temporary driver handle before copying. Never-shared allocations are excluded from that recovery as well as from teardown.

#### VMM export and import

For POSIX export, the shim caches a real CUDA export FD and returns a memfd
virtual shareable handle instead. The application passes that FD through
its existing communication mechanism. The virtual shareable handle has one
fixed 24-byte layout:

| Bytes | Value |
| --- | --- |
| 4 | `CUI\x01` |
| 4 | Creator namespace PID, little-endian |
| 16 | Allocation ID |

The last two fields form an `AllocationReference`. A virtual shareable handle
contains neither a socket path nor a unicast/multicast discriminator. The
importing shim derives the creator's exact socket path from its namespace PID.

The original creator must retain at least one generic allocation handle or local
mapping while any exported descriptor or imported allocation remains usable.
Releasing a handle after mapping it is supported because the mapping retains
the creator allocation. Releasing every creator handle and mapping while keeping
only a virtual shareable FD is outside this contract: the FD stores identity,
not an independent ownership reference to the backing. Imported allocations
also do not extend the creator's lifetime through remote leases.

This is a limitation relative to native CUDA shareable-FD ownership. Coordinator
preflight detects missing creators referenced by tracked imports, but does not
inventory arbitrary application FDs; it cannot detect every surviving FD-only
token after the creator's allocation record has been removed.

On import, B sends A the allocation reference:

```yaml
version: 1
body:
  kind: export
  allocation:
    id: "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
    creator_pid: 41
```

A sends a duplicate of its cached FD using `SCM_RIGHTS` and replies with either
`unicast_export` or `multicast_export`. Only the multicast reply includes
`CUmulticastObjectProp`: CUDA exposes no equivalent query after multicast
import. A unicast importer obtains the authoritative `CUmemAllocationProp`
directly from CUDA after importing the FD. B records the resulting local
handle. Re-exporting B's import still names A. Neither the virtual shareable
handle nor the request contains a durable CUDA FD number.

A POSIX import whose FD is not a virtual shareable handle returns `CUDA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED` before calling CUDA. Non-POSIX imports and unsupported exportable creates are also rejected before acquiring backing. The shim never records unsupported resources for a later checkpoint refusal.

#### Memory IPC adapter

Synchronous `cuMemAlloc_v2` is implemented with POSIX-capable VMM backing from allocation time. The shim rounds the backing size to CUDA's required granularity, reserves and maps a virtual address, and records the requested size separately. It does not move a live native malloc allocation when the application later exports it.

`cuIpcGetMemHandle` returns a virtual IPC memory handle in CUDA's fixed 64-byte value. Unlike a virtual shareable handle, it is not an FD. For a malloc-backed allocation with the example's identities, its decoded fields would look like this:

| Field | Bytes | Example value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `version` | 8 | ASCII `CUIPC001` |
| `creator_pid` | 4 | `41` |
| `allocation` | 16 | `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa` |
| `reserved` | 20 | All zero |
| `requested` | 8 | `2097152` |
| `extent` | 8 | `2097152` |

The integer fields use little-endian encoding. This example assumes the request already meets the device's allocation granularity; otherwise `extent` is larger than `requested`. `cuIpcOpenMemHandle*` derives A's socket from the creator namespace PID, uses the same peer FD service as VMM import, and maps the allocation in B.

Repeated opens in the supported context return the same address and increment a reference count. The final close removes the imported mapping. `cuMemFree_v2` synchronizes the owning context before removing a malloc mapping; a synchronization failure leaves that mapping intact. An imported pointer must be closed, not freed. Foreign native IPC handles are rejected.

Context destruction, primary reset, and final primary release also reclaim
malloc and imported IPC mappings owned by that context. The shim snapshots the
affected records before forwarding teardown without the state mutex, then
reclaims them only after CUDA succeeds. Failed teardown and nonfinal primary
release preserve those records. Explicit VMM allocations survive context
teardown; matching cached operational contexts are cleared so later carrier
work can enter a primary context using the fallback described above. Legacy and
versioned teardown entry points retain their respective native semantics.

The adapter never calls native CUDA memory-IPC functions. It therefore does not need a CUDA checkpoint jobfile to reconstruct this sharing.

#### Threads and synchronization

Application CUDA wrappers run on the calling application thread. On runtime startup (not ABI registration), two additional threads start in that process:

| Thread | Work |
| --- | --- |
| `cuinterpose-peer` | Accepts socket connections and classifies requests. Handles peer export requests using the descriptor cache without the main allocation-state lock or CUDA calls. |
| `cuinterpose-control` | Processes inspection and lifecycle commands one at a time. It enters the recorded CUDA context when a lifecycle operation needs driver calls. |

The peer thread queues control commands; it does not wait for their CUDA operations. A bounded queue refuses excess control requests. This separation lets an importer obtain an FD even while the creator's control thread is busy reconstructing another object.

Allocation and mapping changes normally hold the shim's state mutex. Application multicast calls that can block waiting for other devices, IPC synchronization, and context teardown release that mutex around the driver call. One `unlocked_driver_calls` counter prevents checkpoint entry until they have returned and recorded their results. The application must synchronize object destruction against calls using that object, including context lifetime changes; the shim has no per-object pins or busy counts. During restore the application stays parked, so reconstruction holds the state mutex and updates records directly. The peer listener holds the export-cache mutex through each socket send. Cache removal and checkpoint teardown take the same mutex, so they wait for that send to finish. Sends use the socket timeout; a slow receiver can delay cache mutations until the send finishes or fails.

`ProcessState` owns one memblock registry keyed by allocation ID. Each `Memblock`
is either a unicast `Allocation` or a `MulticastObject`; virtual handles and
address mappings refer to that same registry. Export publication, handle release,
and existing-memblock imports share the registry's lifetime bookkeeping.
`MallocRegion` additionally tracks malloc/IPC reservations, requested sizes, and
open counts. A reservation's lifetime is distinct from its current mapping.
Mappings preserve the application handle used to create them. Retaining a mapped
allocation returns that same handle and increments its application reference count,
including after an earlier release or checkpoint/restore.

CUDA validates application arguments; the shim records successful calls and
propagates ordinary driver errors. Failed malloc/IPC setup releases its unpublished
resources before returning the original error. Context-query errors propagate;
a successful query with no current context is recorded as zero. Surviving
VMM objects also clear a cached context to zero after its successful teardown.
Failed cleanup and irreversible checkpoint mutations remain fail-stop.

The export cache stores an FD and its reply metadata under each allocation ID.
Multicast replies include the creation properties needed by importers to record
and reconstruct the object. This copy lets peer service run without taking the
CUDA state mutex, including while another thread holds that mutex during import.

Inspection projects live memblocks into serializable `Record` values. The
checkpoint manifest maps each namespace PID directly to its records; live CUDA
handles and transient lifecycle bookkeeping remain inside the shim.

These simplified paths show the main actions, not error cleanup:

```text
malloc(size):
    create supported VMM backing and a virtual allocation handle
    reserve and map a virtual address in the current context
    record requested size, backing size, context and mapping
    return the virtual address

export(allocation):
    lock allocation state
    create and cache a real export FD if needed
    create the virtual shareable handle and mark successful sharing
    unlock allocation state
    return the virtual shareable handle

import(virtual_shareable_handle):
    lock allocation state
    resolve the original creator and allocation
    request its cached FD through the peer socket
    import the FD, or reuse an existing local allocation record
    record the virtual allocation or multicast handle and successful sharing
    for memory IPC, map the address while still holding allocation state
    unlock allocation state
    return the virtual handle or mapped address
```

The runtime records its creating PID and rejects inherited state before taking
any mutex. There are no at-fork handlers or child-runtime resets. Real `cuInit`
errors propagate unchanged; memory wrappers return `CUDA_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED`
when no current-process runtime exists. Shim-owned sockets and cached export FDs
are close-on-exec. They remain inherited until exec or exit; the shim does not
support checkpointing a long-lived child forked after CUDA initialization.

### Capture

The application must first stop submitting work, finish outstanding GPU work, and arrange to stay parked through restore. The coordinator does not pause application threads. In particular, **shim preparation runs before native CUDA lock** because saving and removing shared allocations requires working CUDA calls.

The agent inspects every discovered CUDA participant. An enabled annotation or
the launcher as the target container's command requires the shim to be active.
Without either expectation and with no shim mapped, capture uses the native
path. If all participants have both libraries mapped, capture uses CuInterpose
even if the annotation was removed. Missing or partial coverage is an error;
an annotation cannot independently select the checkpoint algorithm.

The agent opens the mapped libraries, matches their device/inode identity to
the process mappings, and hashes those same descriptors. Deleted or replaced
files and inconsistent hashes between participants fail preflight. Library
files must remain stable during capture.

Coordinator `--inspect` contacts the exact namespace-PID socket of every
participant and validates creators, ranges, access permissions, and complete
multicast groups. Missing or unhealthy endpoints fail before preparation and
preserve the source. Inspection is read-only and does not lock the group.

Preparation then sends `BEGIN_CHECKPOINT` to each shim and validates the
returned topology again. Under the process mutex, entry requires `Active` and
zero unlocked driver calls, returns the records, and changes the phase to
`Checkpointing`. Application memory APIs then refuse mutation. Any failure
after entering preparation conservatively terminates the source, including a
failure after successful preflight.

Multicast attachment and binding validation keys devices by namespace PID and
local CUDA ordinal. A binding requires an attachment in that same participant;
an equal ordinal in another participant does not satisfy it.

Every application CUDA call must have returned, outstanding GPU work must have
completed, and the participant set must remain fixed before checkpoint entry.
All sharing peers must be interposed and included in the checkpoint group;
creators must remain available. Neither the counter nor checkpoint entry parks
application threads or drains GPU work.

One coordinator issues each phase once, in order. There are no lifecycle retries,
rollback, or reconnect-and-resume semantics. A lost reply or timeout during
preparation or reconstruction makes the attempt unusable; the agent terminates
the affected workload. A driver error before an ordinary application operation
changes tracked state can be returned
to the caller. Failure after a state-changing operation, or during destructive
capture/restore, terminates the process.

The process phase and stable ownership determine each phase's complete work.
Allocations, mappings, multicast objects, and bindings carry no per-object
checkpoint progress flags. Shared creator allocations own host-carrier contents;
importers reconnect to their creator. A failed phase never resumes halfway.

```

The `BEGIN_CHECKPOINT` requests visit participants sequentially; destructive work starts only after all returned records pass topology validation. Each subsequent lifecycle operation runs concurrently across participants, followed by a barrier before the next operation.

Capture removes the outer objects before their dependencies:

1. `PREPARE_MULTICAST` removes multicast exports, mappings, bindings, and handles.
2. `SAVE_ALLOCATIONS` saves the shared creator bytes while unicast allocations still exist.
3. `PREPARE_UNICAST` drains peer export requests, removes shared mappings, and releases shared driver handles.

Virtual allocation handles, including virtual multicast handles, remain in CPU memory for CRIU alongside mappings, allocation references, and carrier addresses. Private allocations remain native CUDA state. If a destructive phase or later checkpoint step fails, the source must be terminated rather than resumed with sharing removed.

For the 2 MiB example, `SAVE_ALLOCATIONS` copies A's allocation into A's host arena. B saves no second copy. CRIU captures that arena as process memory; there is no separate `aaaaaaaa….bin` file. If A also has a never-shared allocation, that allocation stays on the native CUDA path instead of entering the arena.

### Restore

Before CRIU, the agent verifies the restore bundle against both recorded library
hashes, restores the tool paths and control directory, and removes
the exact socket names for the namespace PIDs in the manifest. CRIU recreates
the process tree, namespace PIDs, shim records, and host carriers. Native CUDA restore reconstructs private memory and
process state, then unlocks CUDA so the shims can make driver calls. The
application remains parked until all shim reconstruction succeeds.
Coordinator sockets use the manifest's namespace PIDs, which CRIU preserves;
native CUDA restore uses resolved process PIDs visible to the native helper.

```

The creator/importer labels describe roles, not disjoint sets of processes: one process can own one allocation and import another. Every participant receives every lifecycle operation, even when it has no work in that operation.

`LOAD_ALLOCATIONS` creates new backing, copies host-carrier bytes back, restores creator mappings and permissions, and makes new export FDs available. After sending its successful LOAD reply, the shim releases the carrier arena. `RESTORE_UNICAST` reconnects importers to those new allocations at their original virtual addresses. Neither operation recreates never-shared allocations.

`RESTORE_MULTICAST` consists of four ordered wire operations:

| Operation | Work | Why wait before continuing? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RESTORE_MULTICAST_CREATORS` | Recreate objects from their recorded properties and publish export FDs. | Importers need the new creator FDs. |
| `RESTORE_MULTICAST_IMPORTERS` | Obtain those FDs and import the objects. | All participants need local handles before starting device attachment. |
| `RESTORE_MULTICAST_DEVICES` | Replay device attachments. | Bind operations can wait for the whole device team. |
| `RESTORE_MULTICAST_BINDINGS` | Replay `BindMem`/`BindAddr`, map the original addresses, and restore permissions. | The application must not resume with incomplete mappings. |

Capture and restore reverse the dependency order, not the number of messages. Capture can remove each process's existing multicast references in one operation. Restore needs creator-to-importer handoffs and whole-team device attachment before binding.

### Checkpoint files and compatibility

`cuinterpose.state` is a **binary, versioned MessagePack file**. Its body is a
map from namespace PID directly to that process's records. Socket paths are derived
from those keys and are not persisted. Control messages and `cuinterpose.state` are limited to 32
MiB to bound allocations from socket frame prefixes and checkpoint files; they
contain metadata, never allocation contents. Here is a shortened decoded view
for the two-worker example.
Allocation-property and handle-count fields are omitted, and binary allocation
IDs are shown as hex strings. Field names and nesting match the serialized data:

```yaml
version: 1
body:
  41:
    - allocation:
        allocation:
          id: "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
          creator_pid: 41
        checkpoint_via_host_carrier: true
        size: 2097152
    - mapping:
        allocation:
          id: "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
          creator_pid: 41
        address: 0x700000000000
        size: 2097152
        offset: 0
        access:
        - location: {location_type: 1, id: 0}
          flags: 3
  42:
    - allocation:
        allocation:
          id: "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
          creator_pid: 41
        checkpoint_via_host_carrier: false
        size: 2097152
    - mapping:
        allocation:
          id: "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
          creator_pid: 41
        address: 0x710000000000
        size: 2097152
        offset: 0
        access:
        - location: {location_type: 1, id: 1}
          flags: 3
```

The outer namespace-PID key identifies the process. The repeated allocation reference
identifies both the allocation and its creator without a separate `creator:
true/false` field. `checkpoint_via_host_carrier: true` means A saves and restores the device bytes
through its CRIU-captured host carrier. Importers do not duplicate that copy;
private allocations use native CUDA checkpointing. No allocation bytes appear
in this metadata file. `offset: 0` maps from the start of the allocation. In the
access records, location type `1` means a CUDA device and flags `3` mean
read/write: A grants GPU 0 access, and B grants GPU 1 access. Addresses are
shown in hex for readability; they are encoded as integers.

Multicast adds records to the same process state. For example, this complete
`multicast_binding` record says that GPU 0 binds the first 2 MiB of allocation
`aaaaaaaa…` into the start of multicast object `bbbbbbbb…` using `BindMem`'s v1
ABI:

```yaml
multicast_binding:
  allocation:
    id: "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb"
    creator_pid: 41
  source:
    memory:
      allocation:
        id: "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
        creator_pid: 41
      offset: 0
  size: 2097152
  offset: 0
  flags: 0
  version: v1
  device: 0
```

The member offset is nested under `source`; the outer offset is into the
multicast object. Separate `multicast`, `multicast_device`, and
`multicast_mapping` records describe the object, attached devices, and virtual
mappings. This binding alone is not a complete multicast checkpoint.

The coordinator sorts records and publishes the state through a temporary file,
file `fsync`, atomic rename, and directory `fsync`. On restore it checks the
namespace PID set, derives the exact socket paths, rebuilds sharing, then
compares a fresh inspection against the captured records. Allocation bytes come
from CRIU's host-carrier images, not this file.

The corresponding section of `manifest.yaml` is ordinary YAML:

```yaml
cuinterpose:
  frontendSHA256: "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
  coreSHA256: "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb"
```

The illustrative hashes above record verified runtime libraries, not the
annotation. Both fields are required when `cuinterpose` is present. Capture
completes coordinator preparation before publishing the checkpoint, and restore
runs reconstruction before releasing the workload. Missing or invalid
coordinator state fails restore. Native checkpoints omit `cuinterpose`; earlier
draft checkpoints containing `cuinterpose: true` are rejected with an instruction
to recreate them.

The private frontend/backend ABI is version **4**. The MessagePack protocol and state envelope, virtual shareable handle, and virtual IPC memory handle are version **1**. Older draft artifacts, including shim PageBroker artifacts, are not migrated or silently interpreted as host-carrier checkpoints.

The shim libraries are part of the checkpointed process. Their files must be
available at the original paths, and the coordinator must understand their
protocol. Before CRIU, restore compares SHA-256 hashes of the exact libraries
supplied by the agent. Mismatches identify the library and expected/actual
hashes; `SkipCompatCheck` does not bypass this check. The frontend also carries a
linker build ID, but SHA-256 is the identity check.

Upgrades that change shim bytes require matching agents or recreated checkpoints;
unrelated agent changes do not invalidate them. Launcher and coordinator bytes
are excluded: those executables are absent from the checkpointed workload.
Archiving libraries with checkpoints remains separate work.

### Security

The control volume is a Pod-local `emptyDir` with a separate `subPath` for each
target container. Unix socket files have mode `0600`; there is no network
listener or new service credential. Socket access relies on filesystem
credentials and mount isolation, not an independent authentication protocol.
Processes given the same directory and credentials can request descriptors or
lifecycle operations. The workload container is a trust boundary, not an
isolation boundary between its own processes; node root and privileged agents
remain trusted.

The coordinator joins the target mount, UTS, IPC, network, and PID namespaces,
but not its user or cgroup namespace. The agent opens trusted executable,
namespace, and checkpoint-directory descriptors before entry, so it does not
resolve the coordinator executable through the workload filesystem. Restore
removes only the expected stale participant socket paths.
The open mount-namespace descriptor pins that namespace; other namespace entry
still depends on the target PID. Command cancellation kills the helper's process
group, including forked descendants, and bounds waiting for output pipes.

Host carriers contain shared workload data in the CRIU images. They require the
same checkpoint storage access controls as other captured process memory; this
proposal adds no encryption or separate credential mechanism. Version checks,
32 MiB message/state limits, socket timeouts, and bounded control queues limit
malformed input and stalled peers. They do not make untrusted checkpoint images
safe to restore. The library installer drops capabilities, disallows privilege
escalation, and uses a read-only root filesystem. It uses the Pod's positive
`runAsUser` when specified, otherwise UID 65532, with `runAsNonRoot: true`,
without changing workload security contexts.

### Configuration

Helm passes the agent image and pull policy to the operator for library
installation. Image pulls use the workload Pod's or ServiceAccount's credentials;
no registry credentials are embedded in the shim.
Set the existing agent image tag field to `<tag>@sha256:<digest>` to pin both
the DaemonSet and installer. Invalid pull policies fail operator startup; a
missing agent image produces a retryable operator-configuration error. Delivery
settings are consulted only for new source Jobs. The installer has equal CPU
requests/limits of `100m` and memory requests/limits of `64Mi`, preserving an
otherwise Guaranteed Pod's QoS classification.

The shim reads `SNAPSHOT_CONTROL_DIR`, defaulting to `/snapshot-control`; Snapshot
uses its canonical control mount for coordinator commands. The protocol reads
`SNAPSHOT_CONTROL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 10 seconds) and
`SNAPSHOT_CARRIER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 3600 seconds for save/load).
Each process reads its own environment; these are internal process settings,
not new CRD fields or a storage selector.

### Monitoring

The coordinator reports failures with the participant endpoint and operation
where available, and exits unsuccessfully. The agent propagates coordinator
errors through existing checkpoint/restore error handling. Transfer byte counts
are correctness checks, not throughput metrics. This stack adds no dedicated
cuinterpose metrics, phase reports, or dashboard.

### Test Plan

Validation belongs to the assembled stack in
[#338](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/snapshot/pull/338); intermediate PRs are source
layers and are not all independently buildable backends.

| Layer | Coverage and expected outcome |
| --- | --- |
| Rust unit/protocol and C/Rust ABI checks | Validate framing, versions, handle layouts, topology, ownership, lifecycle ordering, and ABI size/offset compatibility. |
| Packaged headless probes | Exercise forwarding, runtime-version refusal, lookup without startup, initialization and loader reentry, relative preload followed by chdir, sticky failures, fork/exec ownership, incompatible artifacts, and launcher environment/argument preservation without a GPU. |
| Scripted coordinator exchanges | Verify read-only inspection, barriers, preflight refusal, process-local multicast ordinals, transfer-size checks, lost replies without retry, and failed state publication or missing/corrupt restore state. |
| Go and Helm integration | Verify SnapshotJob delivery and explicit-command validation, unchanged args/environment, collision rejection, configuration retry and adoption, mapped-library identity, mismatch refusal before CRIU, preflight/source-termination boundaries, forked-child cancellation, inherited descriptors, restore mounts, and existing jobfile behavior. |
| Physical-GPU suite | Verify shared and private bytes, importer reconstruction, multicast collectives/graph replay, foreign-import refusal, and context teardown using the real driver. Context cases verify malloc cleanup, other-context isolation, and carrier reconstruction of surviving VMM. Require zero skips on suitable hardware. |
| Cross-node Snapshot E2E | Capture and restore on compatible distinct nodes, then verify workload inference and sharing. The native GPU suite alone does not cover Go namespace orchestration. [#294](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/snapshot/issues/294) tracks opt-in 8-GPU cross-node coverage. |

Run `make check`, `make test`, `make build`, and
`make -C agent/cmd/cuinterpose test-native` on the final assembled revision.
Qualify real multi-process GPU capture/restore, cross-node restore, and a
deliberately mismatched shim bundle; exercise HOST_NUMA and multicast on suitable
hardware. Record unavailable coverage explicitly. Earlier revision results and
coordinator-only tests do not qualify revised native CUDA/CRIU behavior.

### Graduation Criteria

The stack is under review. No beta/GA designation or release date is proposed.
Before treating it as qualified, record passing assembled-artifact checks,
physical-GPU tests without skips, and full cross-node Snapshot capture/restore
with post-restore workload verification. Document the tested GPU, driver,
workload, and artifact versions and retain the explicit operating limits above.
Protocol compatibility beyond the matching version-1 artifacts is not promised.

## Implementation History

As of September 22, 2026, the implementation remains an open PR stack.

#336 consolidates the closed [#334](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/snapshot/pull/334)
and [#335](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/snapshot/pull/335); their review discussions
remain available. The runtime slice #360 and memory-IPC slice #342 are part of
the dependency chain, not follow-up work.

## Alternatives

- **Checkpoint each CUDA process independently:** cannot reconstruct shared
  backing and multicast dependencies, even if private state restores correctly.
- **Native memory IPC for shim-managed malloc:** the adapter instead allocates
  tracked VMM backing from the start so exports, ownership, and reconstruction
  use the same model as VMM sharing.
- **PageBroker storage inside the shim:** host carriers keep the shim independent
  of native storage protocols; CRIU already captures the owning process's bytes.
- **Per-object progress and lifecycle retry:** the implementation uses one process
  phase and stable ownership, with fail-stop behavior after destructive errors.
  A lost reply cannot establish whether a mutation completed safely.
- **Rewriting Pod preload environment:** a static launcher receives the resolved
  environment, avoiding duplicated image, ConfigMap, and Secret precedence logic.
  It requires an explicit command. Registry entrypoint discovery and NRI-based
