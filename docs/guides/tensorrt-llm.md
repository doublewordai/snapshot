# Deploy a TensorRT-LLM replica

This guide makes a TensorRT-LLM workload snapshot-ready by mounting an
entrypoint into a TensorRT-LLM runtime image, implementing Snapshot's
[workload contract](../reference/workload-contract.md). The example runs the
TensorRT-LLM image that includes TensorRT-LLM and its runtime dependencies,
unmodified. `deployment.yaml` pins the exact upstream image, and one
program, `app.py`, is mounted into it from a ConfigMap to prepare
TensorRT-LLM for checkpoint and validate it after restore. The Snapshot
agent injects the restore tooling at runtime.

> [!NOTE]
> TensorRT-LLM support is experimental and currently limited to a single GPU.

## 1. Download the example files

Download [`app.py`](tensorrt-llm/app.py),
[`deployment.yaml`](tensorrt-llm/deployment.yaml), and
[`restore-deployment.yaml`](tensorrt-llm/restore-deployment.yaml) from the
repository:

```bash
mkdir -p tensorrt-llm-snapshot
cd tensorrt-llm-snapshot

curl --fail --location \
  --output app.py \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-dynamo/snapshot/main/docs/guides/tensorrt-llm/app.py

curl --fail --location \
  --output deployment.yaml \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-dynamo/snapshot/main/docs/guides/tensorrt-llm/deployment.yaml

curl --fail --location \
  --output restore-deployment.yaml \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai-dynamo/snapshot/main/docs/guides/tensorrt-llm/restore-deployment.yaml
```

The program loads the model selected in `deployment.yaml` and calls
`LLM.generate()` to initialize TensorRT-LLM. The synchronous call returns only
after generation finishes, so no request remains in flight. The program then
runs `gc.collect()` and writes `ready-for-snapshot` when it reaches the safe
checkpoint point.

TensorRT-LLM does not use a framework pause or sleep call in this example. The
model and initialized CUDA state remain resident. After restore, the checkpointed
process calls `LLM.generate()` again and starts an API on port 8000. It writes
`trtllm-restore-ready` only after the generation succeeds and the API is
listening. To validate the restored replica, send a `POST` request to
`/generate` with a JSON body such as
`{"prompt":"What is the capital of Italy?"}`.

`deployment.yaml` runs the TensorRT-LLM `1.3.0rc24` release image, pinned by
digest, unmodified, and mounts `app.py` at `/snapshot-app` from the
`tensorrt-llm-app` ConfigMap created in step 2. A release candidate is used
deliberately: the `1.2.1` GA image fails at `import tensorrt` because
`libnvonnxparser.so.10` is missing from it, and no 1.3.0 GA image exists yet.
Move to the first 1.3.x GA once it is published.
`TLLM_NCCL_SYMMETRIC_ZERO_COPY=0` disables NCCL registered windows that CUDA
checkpoint does not support. `UCX_TLS=tcp,self` avoids RDMA mappings that CRIU
cannot restore. MPI request broadcasts use `OMPI_MCA_pml=ob1` and
`OMPI_MCA_btl=tcp,self` rather than UCX: restricting UCX to TCP alone does not
prevent TCP keepalive from closing connections during a large CRIU dump.
CRIU puts sockets into repair mode as it visits each process; a peer not yet
in repair can time out while waiting for keepalive replies. The closed socket
is then saved in the checkpoint, so changing addresses during restore cannot
repair it.

If the workload requires UCX, the tested alternative is `OMPI_MCA_pml=ucx`,
`UCX_TLS=tcp,self`, and `UCX_TCP_KEEPIDLE=inf`. Set these before starting the
workload, not only on the restore pod. Disabling TCP keepalive also disables
that mechanism for detecting dead peers during normal execution; the example
keeps `ob1`/TCP as its default. These settings change MPI's CPU communication,
not TensorRT-LLM's CUDA collective strategy.

The source and restore pods must use the same immutable image and mount the
Snapshot control volume at `/snapshot-control`.

These manifests use native CUDA checkpointing. If you enable
[CuInterpose](../development/cuinterpose.md), this Deployment must deliver
`libcuinterpose.so`, `libcuinterpose_core.so`, and the executable
`cuinterpose-launch` at `/tmp/snapshot-cuda` before the workload starts. Prefix
the existing Python command with `/tmp/snapshot-cuda/cuinterpose-launch` and set
the source Pod annotation `nvidia.com/cuinterpose-enabled: "true"`. The launcher
preserves the runtime-resolved environment, including existing preloads.
Adding the annotation to a running Pod cannot activate the shim.

For a SnapshotJob, the operator delivers those artifacts and wraps the source
command automatically when its Pod template opts in. Keep the explicit
`command: ["python3", "/snapshot-app/app.py"]`. Restore requires agents supplying
the same library bytes; the restore placeholder keeps its inert command.

## 2. Create the app.py ConfigMap

Set the namespace where the TensorRT-LLM pod will run, and create the
ConfigMap `deployment.yaml` mounts `app.py` from:

```bash
export SNAPSHOT_NAMESPACE=<namespace>
kubectl get namespace "$SNAPSHOT_NAMESPACE"

kubectl create configmap tensorrt-llm-app \
  --namespace "$SNAPSHOT_NAMESPACE" \
  --from-file=app.py
```

`kubectl create configmap` fails if the ConfigMap already exists. To update it
after editing `app.py`, use `apply` instead:

```bash
kubectl create configmap tensorrt-llm-app \
  --namespace "$SNAPSHOT_NAMESPACE" \
  --from-file=app.py \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

## 3. Deploy TensorRT-LLM

Select a model supported by the chosen TensorRT-LLM image through
`SNAPSHOT_MODEL` in [`deployment.yaml`](tensorrt-llm/deployment.yaml):

```yaml
containers:
  - name: main
    env:
      - name: SNAPSHOT_MODEL
        value: Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B
```

The example uses one GPU, the PyTorch backend, and a maximum sequence length of
512 tokens. Engine sizing is set through `TRTLLM_MAX_NUM_TOKENS` (default
`1024`), `TRTLLM_MAX_BATCH_SIZE` (default `1`), and
`TRTLLM_FREE_GPU_MEMORY_FRACTION` (default `0.10`). `app.py` sets
`trust_remote_code=False`; Qwen3 needs no custom model code. Edit
`TRUST_REMOTE_CODE` in `app.py` for a checkpoint that ships its own modeling
code. Revalidate checkpoint and restore before changing the model,
TensorRT-LLM image, GPU count, backend, or engine settings.

> [!NOTE]
> This example runs TensorRT-LLM through the `LLM` API rather than `trtllm-serve`,
> so the standard `trtllm-serve` command-line arguments do not apply. The model is
> selected with `SNAPSHOT_MODEL`, and other engine settings are configured on the
> [`LLM` API](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/llm-api/reference.html) in
> `app.py`.

Deploy the edited manifest:

```bash
kubectl apply \
  --namespace "$SNAPSHOT_NAMESPACE" \
  --filename deployment.yaml
```

Wait until the TensorRT-LLM replica finishes initialization and becomes safe to
checkpoint:

```bash
kubectl rollout status \
  --namespace "$SNAPSHOT_NAMESPACE" \
  deployment/tensorrt-llm-source \
  --timeout=30m
```

List the generated Pod:

```bash
kubectl get pods \
  --namespace "$SNAPSHOT_NAMESPACE" \
  --selector app=tensorrt-llm-source
```

Use that Pod name in the `PodSnapshot` created during the next step. The
readiness probe succeeds after `app.py` writes `ready-for-snapshot`.
