"""Data model for one benchmark run.

A `RunResult` is the raw, reviewable output of a single `run` invocation (one
model, one engine, cold start and/or restore). It is written verbatim to disk
as JSON by `results.py` and is the only input `report.py` reads back.

Every timing field that comes from a Kubernetes object (pod creation, a
condition's `lastTransitionTime`, a container's `started_at`) is stored as the
`datetime` the API server reported, not a wall-clock timestamp captured by the
polling loop — this makes every derived duration a difference between two
object-owned timestamps, not an artifact of how often the benchmark polled.
