Corresponding source
================================================================================

Upstream source for the third-party components redistributed in this image.

  dpkg/        Debian source packages for the system packages this image adds
               on top of its base image, each pinned to the source version its
               binary was built from. DELTA.tsv lists exactly which.
               SKIPPED.txt records any package whose source was not fetched,
               with the reason. A build only succeeds when every such entry is
               a package published without source by an NVIDIA repository; any
               other fetch failure fails the build.
  criu/        CRIU source at the commit this image was built from.
  go/vendor/   Source for the Go modules linked into the binaries in this
               image; modules.txt records the exact module set.

CuInterpose frontend, core, coordinator, and launcher sources are in
/legal/cuinterpose/source. The launcher uses only Rust's standard library. The
locked libc dependency, Rust standard-library sources, and toolchain license notices are
in /legal/cuinterpose/rust. Cargo.lock records the dependency version; the
builder pins Rust 1.95.0 by container digest.

Source for the base image's own contents is published by NVIDIA and is not
duplicated here:

NVIDIA-authored code in this image is Apache-2.0 and published at
