# CuInterpose Rust components

CuInterpose reconstructs same-node CUDA VMM sharing, supported memory IPC, and multicast
around native CUDA checkpoint/restore. It consists of the GNU/glibc
`libcuinterpose.so` C frontend, lazily loaded Rust `libcuinterpose_core.so`, and
static-musl `cuinterpose-coordinator` and `cuinterpose-launch` executables.

See the [SNEP-295](../../../../docs/proposals/295-cuinterpose/README.md) for interception,
ownership, protocol, capture/restore ordering, and isolation.

## Build and test

From the repository root:

```sh
make -C agent cuinterpose-test
make -C agent cuinterpose-build
```

These targets use GCC and the digest-pinned Rust 1.95 Bookworm builder in
`agent/Dockerfile`. The workspace uses edition 2024 with MSRV 1.88.
The exported artifacts are in `agent/cmd/cuinterpose/build/`.
Always test and ship a matched frontend/core/coordinator set.
The standard-library-only launcher uses the existing musl target and preserves
its executable permission in the exported bundle.

The protocol records CUDA metadata as explicit fixed-width primitive fields.
CUDA FFI structs stay inside the core crate and are never serialized directly.

For local development, install GNU and musl targets and musl tools, then run
`make native` or `make test-native` from `agent/cmd/cuinterpose`. On hosts
whose default linker is not the system GNU toolchain, set
`CARGO_TARGET_X86_64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_GNU_LINKER=/usr/bin/gcc`.
The C frontend requires GCC 15 or newer for `musttail`. The builder copies it from
the digest-pinned `gcc:15.2.0-bookworm` image. Set `FRONTEND_CC` for local builds.

The packaged gate runs GCC warnings-as-errors, rustfmt, strict Clippy, Rust
unit tests, scripted coordinator checks, and process-isolated loader/startup checks. The loader
fixtures provide CUDA symbol addresses and return values; CUDA memory behavior
is tested on real GPUs.

Physical-GPU tests live in `../tests/gpu`. Stage a matched artifact set with:

```sh
python3 ../tests/gpu/stage.py --help
```

The staging layout is `DEST/tests/gpu` and `DEST/build`. Run pytest and
require all GPU cases to pass with zero skips. The suite calls the native
CUDA checkpoint API directly.
These tests cover shared/private contents, unicast import reconstruction,
multicast collective/graph replay, raw-import refusal, and context teardown.
The context cases require one GPU and verify malloc cleanup, surviving direct
VMM, and carrier reconstruction after context destruction or reset. They do not exercise
the Go agent's namespace-entry wrapper. Full Snapshot qualification additionally
requires cross-node capture, restore, and post-restore workload inference.

## Module boundaries

| Crate | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `abi` | Private C-layout frontend/backend tables using cudarc CUDA types |
| `protocol` | CUDA metadata, allocation references, state entries, versioned MessagePack, and FD transport |
| `core` | Driver calls, process runtimes, tracking, host carriers, lifecycle |
| `coordinator` | CLI, participants, topology validation, barriers, durable state |
| `launcher` | Preserve the resolved environment, prepend the shim, and exec the workload |

The private C ABI is version **4**. The MessagePack wire/state format, virtual
shareable handle, and virtual IPC memory handle are version **1**.
Earlier experimental artifacts are rejected, not translated. Rust
objects, allocators, mutexes, and unwinding never cross the library boundary.
Debug and release builds use `panic = "abort"` for the entire Rust workspace,
including the coordinator and launcher. A panic terminates the process without
stack unwinding; ordinary `Result` errors retain their normal handling. Cargo's unit
test harness still uses unwinding.
`FrontendAbi` contains the resolver supplied by the C frontend; `BackendAbi`
contains the initialization, context, and memory callbacks supplied by the Rust backend.
The frontend is outside this workspace in `../frontend`. `make frontend`
uses cbindgen 0.29.4 to generate the C header from the ABI crate's explicit
`repr(C)` tables, then compiles it with GCC. The pinned cbindgen CLI reads
`abi/cbindgen.toml`; the generated private header includes the `cuda.h` copied
from the pinned CUDA development image. Cbindgen emits only the two private
tables and the ABI version, not CUDA declarations. Generated headers stay in
`../build`.
Rust table initialization and C static assertions check the forwarding
functions against the canonical callback signatures. An ABI test compiles
the generated C declarations with size, alignment, and field-offset assertions
computed from Rust's layouts. Cbindgen is not linked into either shipped library
or the coordinator.
The frontend linker script `../frontend/libcuinterpose.ldscript` is the
authoritative allowlist of workload-visible definitions; every unlisted
definition is localized. The `RTLD_LOCAL` Rust backend exports only
`cuinterpose_core_init`.
Its glibc `dlvsym` bootstrap requires glibc 2.34 or newer. It does not override
explicit `dlvsym` or implement a custom ELF loader.
The backend is loaded through glibc's `$ORIGIN` using the frontend's load-time
directory, so changing directory does not break sibling discovery. Manual
`LD_PRELOAD` paths must be absolute to remain valid across a later exec; the
launcher prepends `/tmp/snapshot-cuda/libcuinterpose.so` to the existing
`LD_PRELOAD` using OS strings, retaining non-UTF-8 values and argument boundaries.
It executes the supplied command directly with no persistent parent process.
SnapshotJob delivery requires an explicit target-container `command`; the
operator leaves its `args` and `env` unchanged. Ordinary Pods must place both
libraries at `/tmp/snapshot-cuda` and preload the frontend before startup.

### CUDA bindings

The Rust ABI and core use cudarc 0.19.9's generated CUDA 13.1 types and
constants directly, including `CUresult`, allocation properties, access
descriptors, flags, device identifiers, and handles. The C frontend uses the
matching canonical declarations from the pinned NVIDIA `cuda.h`; this project
does not redefine those CUDA types or values.

Only `std`, `driver`, `cuda-13010`, and `dynamic-loading` features are enabled;
the last avoids a link-time or runtime CUDA library requirement. No cudarc loader or CUDA-call
wrapper is invoked: every call still uses the frontend's `FrontendAbi.resolve`
callback. Its safe context/buffer owners are not used because the workload owns
those resources, and checkpoint teardown/reconstruction requires explicit
context and DMA cleanup. The coordinator shares cudarc's generated CUDA types
through the protocol crate, but it does not load the CUDA driver or issue CUDA
calls.

CUDA Runtime 11 is unsupported. Runtime driver-entry lookup wrappers require
version 12.0 or newer, verified through `cudaRuntimeGetVersion` from the same
library as the resolved lookup function. Older or unverifiable versions return
`cudaErrorInitializationError` before calling the lookup or accessing its output
and status pointers. Use one runtime library per process, visible globally or
already retained through an intercepted handle lookup. Multiple runtimes and
an undiscovered runtime confined to `RTLD_LOCAL` are outside the supported scope.

## Error handling

Application calls use CUDA to validate arguments and return its errors. The shim
translates its virtual handles and records operations only after CUDA succeeds;
it does not duplicate driver bounds, alignment, or overlap checks. Checks that
protect the shim's own handle encoding, supported checkpoint contract, and
checkpoint metadata remain local to those responsibilities. Unpublished resources
created by an application call are cleaned up on failure. Failed cleanup or
irreversible checkpoint mutation is fail-stop.

## Operating constraints

Before preparation, the agent checks the mapped frontend/core identities in
every discovered CUDA participant. Coordinator `--inspect` sends the existing
read-only `INSPECT` request to those participants and validates topology without
entering checkpoint mode. Missing libraries or endpoints and incomplete coverage
fail before mutation. Inspection does not lock the group: preparation still
validates its `BEGIN_CHECKPOINT` replies, and any failure after preparation
begins conservatively terminates the source.

Capture records two library SHA-256 hashes. Restore compares the exact supplied
libraries before CRIU, independently of compatibility skipping; launcher and
coordinator executable bytes are not part of this identity. Keep library files
stable during capture. Changed shim bytes require matching artifacts or a new
checkpoint; obsolete boolean manifests must be recreated.

The Go namespace command helper pins the mount namespace and executes the open
host binary through an inherited descriptor. Other namespace lookups still use
the target PID. Cancellation kills the helper's process group, including the
forked coordinator or restore helper, and bounds waiting for inherited output
pipes. Coordinator sockets use captured namespace PIDs; native CUDA restore
uses the resolved process PIDs visible to its helper.

Applications must finish all CUDA calls and GPU work before `BEGIN_CHECKPOINT`
and remain parked through restore. Entry closes the memory API and returns stable
records under the process mutex. A process-wide counter excludes entry during
unlocked driver calls; application code owns synchronization of object lifetimes.
Only exactly POSIX-FD exportable VMM and multicast are supported. Unsupported
exportable creations, non-POSIX multicast, and foreign imports fail at the API
before creating driver state. Tracked unicast allocations support pinned DEVICE
and HOST_NUMA backing; nonexportable VMM creation remains on the native path.
All sharing peers must use the shim and belong to
the fixed checkpoint group. One coordinator executes each phase once; failed or
ambiguous phases are never retried, rolled back, or resumed. Per-object progress
flags are unnecessary because a mutation failure terminates the process.
Never-shared allocations remain native-owned even when exportable.

The original creator must retain a generic allocation handle or local mapping
while any exported descriptor or imported allocation remains usable. Releasing
a handle while retaining its mapping is supported. A virtual shareable FD stores
identity and does not independently retain creator backing; imported allocations
do not acquire remote ownership leases. FD-only creator lifetime is therefore
outside the supported contract. Preflight checks tracked imports, not arbitrary
application FDs, and cannot detect every remaining FD-only token.

Successful intercepted `cuInit` starts the shim; function lookup creates no
workers or endpoint. Fork before CUDA initialization allows each child to
initialize independently. After CUDA initialization, children must exec or exit;
CUDA initialization errors propagate, and shim memory calls reject inherited
runtime state before taking any lock. Shim-owned FDs are close-on-exec.
Long-lived fork children during checkpoint are outside this contract.
Failed destructive capture or reconstruction cannot safely resume the application. Unknown asynchronous-copy completion is fail-stop.
Host carriers are the only shim storage implementation. They save shared creator
bytes; private allocations remain native CUDA state. DEVICE backing uses
asynchronous CUDA copies, while HOST_NUMA backing uses CPU copies through a
temporary host-accessible VMM alias of the full allocation. Restore recreates
the original allocation properties, including NUMA placement, before reconnecting
importers. There is no PageBroker client, backend selection, or save-all mode in
the shim.

The memory-IPC adapter implements synchronous malloc, IPC export/open/close,
free, and address-range lookup through tracked VMM. It does not call native
memory IPC. It requires fully interposed peers; foreign native handles are
rejected. Event IPC, pool IPC, managed/async/pitched allocation families, and
general cross-context peer-access emulation are outside its supported scope.

Successful context destruction, primary-context reset, and final primary-context
release reclaim that context's malloc and imported IPC mappings. A nonfinal
primary release and failed teardown leave those allocations intact. Explicit
VMM allocations survive; their cached operational context is cleared so later
carrier work can use a primary context. DEVICE backing uses its device ordinal
for this fallback; HOST_NUMA backing uses CUDA device zero without changing the
allocation's NUMA node ID. Applications must synchronize context lifetime
changes against other uses of that context.
Carrier memory is registered only for a save/load transfer and unregistered
before its registration context is released.

Multicast membership uses `(namespace PID, local device ordinal)`. Each
participant must add and bind its device in the same process. Different ranks
may each use local device zero; adding a device in one process and binding it
from another is outside the supported scope.
