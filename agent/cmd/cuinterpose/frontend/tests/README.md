# C frontend tests

From `agent/cmd/cuinterpose`, run:

```sh
python3 frontend/tests/run.py --artifacts build --loader-only
```

Linux/amd64, GCC, cbindgen, CUDA headers, and a built frontend are required.
`--loader-only` uses an independent mock core before the Rust core is assembled.
Omit it once matched backend artifacts and Python MessagePack are available
to run the actual-core cases as well. No GPU or root access is needed.

Small C shared libraries model the driver, runtime, and versioned backend ABI.
Fresh processes exercise direct calls, all seven resolvers, legacy/v2 argument
forwarding, query failures, non-CUDA passthrough, provider lifetime, lazy loading,
ABI rejection, concurrent cold loading, and constructor reentry. The mock
handshake registers a frontend without resolving CUDA callbacks or starting
runtime services; its dispatch table is immutable. The concurrent case holds
16 callers in the handshake before any can publish, and constructor overlap
requires both callers to succeed without a frontend-wide loading lock.
Same-thread constructor reentry is refused without poisoning later calls.
The scope case checks that `dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT)` and `dlsym(RTLD_NEXT)` from a
plugin opened with `RTLD_LOCAL` find its private dependency. `failures.so`,
preloaded after the frontend, checks that `dlsym(RTLD_NEXT)` skips the calling
library. The resolver-bootstrap case makes the first intercepted `dlsym` calls
from two threads while one holds glibc's loader lock.
Thread-scoped loader faults verify that a failed private load reuses a published
backend, failure without a winner stays sticky, and CUDA retention failure
blocks CUDA without breaking unrelated or excluded-namespace symbol lookups.
Actual-core cases verify endpoint
activation, constructor concurrency, fork/exec ownership, and sticky startup failure. These
fixtures are not CUDA device or checkpoint/restore qualification.

Run `make test-native` from `agent/cmd/cuinterpose` for the assembled CPU suite,
including the static launcher's environment/argument preservation and exec PID
tests, plus coordinator `--inspect` coverage for complete participants, invalid
topology, unhealthy replies, and missing endpoints. Read-only inspection must
send no preparation commands and create no checkpoint state. Loader fixtures
use test-local preload paths; the agent's capture contract instead requires
both libraries at `/tmp/snapshot-cuda` before startup.

The frontend finds glibc's `dlsym` with `dlvsym` and passes `RTLD_DEFAULT` and
`RTLD_NEXT` lookups to it as tail calls, so glibc searches the original caller's
scope. It inspects only lookups with an explicit handle. It does not chain
arbitrary `dlsym` replacements or interpose explicit `dlvsym` calls.
Separate loader namespaces are not CUDA-interposition targets. Tests do not
promise these unsupported composition behaviors.
