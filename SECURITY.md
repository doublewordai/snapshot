# Report a Security Vulnerability

To report a potential security vulnerability in any NVIDIA product, please use either:
* This web form: [Security Vulnerability Submission Form](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/support/submit-security-vulnerability/), or
* Send email to: [NVIDIA PSIRT](mailto:psirt@nvidia.com)

If reporting a potential vulnerability via email, please encrypt it using NVIDIA’s public PGP key ([see PGP Key page](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/security/pgp-key/)) and include the following information:
1. Product/Driver name and version/branch that contains the vulnerability
2. Type of vulnerability (code execution, denial of service, buffer overflow, etc.)
3. Instructions to reproduce the vulnerability
4. Proof-of-concept or exploit code
5. Potential impact of the vulnerability, including how an attacker could exploit the vulnerability

See https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/security/ for past NVIDIA Security Bulletins and Notices.

## Coordinated disclosure

NVIDIA PSIRT triages every report and coordinates any resulting fix and
disclosure under NVIDIA's coordinated vulnerability disclosure process. What
that process covers — how reports are evaluated, and what NVIDIA does and does
not commit to — is described on the
[NVIDIA PSIRT policies page](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/security/psirt-policies/).
Snapshot does not set separate terms; that policy governs. Note in particular
that NVIDIA does not guarantee a specific resolution for every reported issue.

## Reporter credit

With the reporter's agreement, NVIDIA PSIRT may recognize them for a valid,
privately reported vulnerability — on NVIDIA's acknowledgement page, or in the
security bulletin for the issue. Recognition is discretionary and arranged by
PSIRT as part of the process above. It is never given through GitHub Security
Advisories; Snapshot does not publish those.

## Verifying what you run

From `v0.2.0` on, every published artifact — the operator image, the agent
image, and the Helm chart — is signed in CI with
[Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) cosign keyless signing. Earlier releases
predate the signing pipeline and carry SBOMs only; they are not signed
retroactively. There is no key to distribute: the signing identity is this
repository's release workflow, and each signature is recorded in the public
Rekor transparency log. Images additionally carry SLSA provenance and an SBOM
as OCI attestations, and each release ships SPDX and CycloneDX SBOMs alongside
a signed `SHA256SUMS`.

Before trusting a pulled image or chart, verify it. The exact `cosign verify`
and `cosign verify-blob` invocations, including the certificate identity to
require, are in [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md#verifying-a-release). Verification needs
cosign v3.0 or newer.

Be precise about what each part establishes. The signature identifies the
*workflow* that produced the artifact — this repository's release workflow at a
release tag — and nothing more. The source commit is recorded in the SLSA
provenance attestation, so tying an artifact to a commit means reading the
provenance as well as checking the signature; RELEASE.md shows both. Neither is
a statement that the artifact is free of vulnerabilities — for that, report
anything you find through the process above.

## Supported versions

Snapshot is pre-1.0. Security fixes are applied to the most recent minor release
line only.

If you are running a pre-release or an older patch version, upgrade to the latest
patch release on the supported line to pick up a fix. This policy is revisited at
1.0, when more than one line may be supported at a time.
